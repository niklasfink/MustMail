   #### Docker compose
Use Docker Compose## Usage

Set up your application to send emails through MustMail by configuring the SMTP settings like this:

```
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=9025
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=servers@example.com
SMTP_SECURE=false
```

Names for these settings might vary depending on your app—check its documentation if you're not sure.

If you're running MustMail in Docker and your app is in another container on the same network, use the container name (e.g. `mustmail`) instead of `localhost` for `SMTP_HOST`.

**Important**: The sender address (`SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`) used by your application must be one of the addresses configured in the `AllowedSenders` list. MustMail will validate the sender address from each incoming email and reject any that aren't whitelisted.

> [!TIP]
> Test your setup with a simple SMTP test tool to make sure everything's working before going live.ement. Fill in your values and you're ready to go.

## About
As of January 2023, Microsoft disabled basic authentication for Exchange, requiring users to switch to OAuth. While basic authentication for SMTP AUTH is still available if you have "Security defaults" turned off, this application offers a solution if you want "Security Defaults" enabled and the application you are trying to send emails from does not support SMTP AUTH using OAuth, and you cannot or do not want to use direct send.

This application acts as a simple SMTP server with no authentication or encryption. When it receives an email, it sends it using the Microsoft Graph API authenticated via OAuth.

Application sends email → MustMail receives the email → MustMail sends the email using Microsoft Graph → Recipient receives the email

## Prerequisites
- A Microsoft 365 Tenant.
- A user with appropriate admin roles (Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, Application Administrator, or Cloud Application Administrator) who can grant Application `Mail.Send` and `User.Read.All` API permissions.
- The email addresses used in AllowedSenders must be valid addresses within the tenant.

## Azure App Creation
1. Go to the ['App registrations' section in Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade).
2. Click 'New Registration'.
3. Enter a name and leave everything else as default.
4. Navigate to 'API permissions' and click 'Add a permission'.
5. Choose 'Microsoft Graph', then select 'Application permissions', then find `Mail.Send` and tick it. Do the same for `User.Read.All`. Finally, press 'Add permissions'.
6. Grant admin consent by clicking 'Grant admin consent for Tenant Name' (where Tenant Name is the name of your Microsoft 365 tenant). Hit 'Yes' at confirmation.
7. Navigate to 'Certificates & secrets', choose the 'Client secrets' tab, then click 'New client secret', enter a description and set expiry to 24 months or a custom value.
    > [!TIP]
    > Set a reminder in your calendar now for 24 months' time to renew and update this secret.
8. Copy the secret value and make note of it.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The secret value is only displayed once.
9. The Client ID and Tenant ID can be found in the overview tab.

## Installation
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not set SMTP Host to anything other than `localhost` because the server does not have authentication or encryption!

### Binary

#### Windows
1. Download the binary release `MustMail-v0.0.0-win-x64.zip` (where 0.0.0 is the latest version) from [here](https://github.com/bxdavies/MustMail/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip file to `C:\MustMail`.
3. Create an `appsettings.json` file in the same directory as the executable.
4. Add the following to the file and fill in ClientId, TenantId, ClientSecret, and AllowedSenders between the empty double quotes:
```json
{
  "Graph": {
    "ClientId": "",
    "TenantId": "",
    "ClientSecret": ""
  },
  "LogLevel": "Information",
  "AllowedSenders": [
    "servers@example.com",
    "notifications@example.com"
  ],
  "Smtp": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 9025
  }
}
```
5. Launch the executable, approve the firewall prompt, and test with [SMTP Test Tool](https://github.com/georgjf/SMTPtool).
6. Open 'Task Scheduler'.
7. Click 'Import Task' and select the `MustMail.xml` file located at `C:\MustMail`.
8. Click 'Change User or Group'.
9. Enter your username (your folder name in C:\Users) in the textbox and click 'Check Names'. It should find your username, then click 'Ok'.
10. Click 'OK'.
11. Right-click on the task and press 'Run'.
12. Test again with [SMTP Test Tool](https://github.com/georgjf/SMTPtool).

#### Linux
1. Download the binary release `MustMail-v0.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz` (replace `0.0.0` with the latest version) from [here](https://github.com/bxdavies/MustMail/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive to `/opt/MustMail` (you may need sudo):
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/MustMail
sudo tar -xzf MustMail-v0.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /opt/MustMail
```
3. Change to the installation directory: `cd /opt/MustMail`.
4. Create the appsettings.json file alongside the executable: `sudo nano appsettings.json`.
5. Add the following to the file and fill in ClientId, TenantId, ClientSecret, and AllowedSenders between the empty double quotes:
```json
{
  "Graph": {
    "ClientId": "",
    "TenantId": "",
    "ClientSecret": ""
  },
  "LogLevel": "Information",
  "AllowedSenders": [
    "servers@example.com",
    "notifications@example.com"
  ],
  "Smtp": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 9025
  }
}
```
6. Make the executable runnable: `sudo chmod +x MustMail`.
7. Create a systemd service to run MustMail once at startup after the network is online:
   a) Create the service file: `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mustmail.service`
   b) Add this:
```
[Unit]
Description=Run MustMail once after network is online
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/opt/MustMail
ExecStart=/opt/MustMail/MustMail

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
8. Reload systemd to apply changes: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
9. Enable the service so it runs once at boot: `sudo systemctl enable mustmail.service`.
10. Reboot your system or start the service manually to test: `sudo systemctl start mustmail.service`.
11. Verify it ran successfully: `sudo systemctl status mustmail.service`
12. Test with telnet following [these instructions from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11988455)

### Docker image

Run MustMail in a container with these simple steps.

#### Docker run
Start MustMail listening on localhost port 9025. Override any environment variable below to match your setup.
```bash
docker run --name MustMail
-e Smtp__Host="localhost" \
-e Smtp__Port=9025 \
-e Graph__TenantId="" \
-e Graph__ClientId="" \
-e Graph__ClientSecret="" \
-e AllowedSenders__0="servers@example.com" \
-e AllowedSenders__1="notifications@example.com" \
-e LogLevel="Warning" \
-d ghcr.io/bxdavies/mustmail
```

#### Docker compose
Use Docker Compose for easier management. Fill in your values and you’re ready to go.
```yml
version: "3"

services:
  mustmail:
    image: ghcr.io/bxdavies/mustmail
    container_name: mustmail
    environment:
      - Smtp__Host="localhost"
      - Smtp__Port=9025
      - Graph__TenantId=""
      - Graph__ClientId=""
      - Graph__ClientSecret=""
      - SendFrom="servers@example.com"
      - LogLevel="Warning"
    restart: unless-stopped
```
## Usage

Set up your application to send emails through MustMail by configuring the SMTP settings like this:

```
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=9025
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=servers@example.com
SMTP_SECURE=false
```

Names for these settings might vary depending on your app—check its documentation if you’re not sure.

If you’re running MustMail in Docker and your app is in another container on the same network, use the container name (e.g. `mustmail`) instead of `localhost` for `SMTP_HOST`.

> [!TIP]
> Test your setup with a simple SMTP test tool to make sure everything’s working before going live.

### Quick SMTP testing with Docker

If you want to quickly test MustMail, you can spin up a test SMTP client container. For example, try [hko/swaks](https://hub.docker.com/r/chko/swaks):

```bash
docker run --network docker_default --rm -ti chko/swaks --to name@example.com --from servers@example.com --server mustmail --port 9025 --header "Subject:first contact"
```

- `--to` sets the recipient email address (change this to where you want the test email delivered).
- `--from` should match the address you’ve configured as your sender in MustMail.
- `--server` is the hostname or container name for MustMail (use `mustmail` if you’re on the same Docker network).
- `--port` sets the SMTP port (default is 9025).
- `--header "Subject:first contact"` sets the subject line for your test email.
- If you’re using Docker Compose or a custom network, update `--network docker_default` to match your setup.

## Environment variables & appsettings.json reference

Log levels can be found on the Serilog wiki [here](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Configuration-Basics#minimum-level).

### Environment variables
